# whatsapp_chat_analyzer

This project aims to give some stats of conversations in the whatsapp application chats. It gives 6 insights into the chat:

**1.** Daily message frequency. Tells how many messages are sent every day.

**2. ** Month frequency. For each month counts the number of messages sent.

**3.** Day of week frequency. 

The above 3 elements are shown in a graph.

**4.**  For each person in the chat, counts number of messages sent by each.

**5.** Counts the ocurrences of certain words. 

The later 2 are printed in console output. 

**6.** Day of week-time of day punchcard. 

This last item is exported as a csv files with the information to create a punchcard with the vertical axis being the day of week, horizontal axis being time of day (given in 24h format), and for each day of week-time of day, the size of the point.
